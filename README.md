# Exploratory and Descriptive Data Analysis

The project involves performing exploratory and descriptive data analysis on two public datasets from the City of Los Angeles.

## Objective
To analyze and test the hypothesis that the statistics of "affordable housing projects" in a ZIP code are related to the health inspection scores of restaurants in that ZIP code.

## Datasets
1. [Restaurant and Market Health Inspections](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/restaurant-and-market-health-inspections)
2. [Affordable Housing Projects List](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hcidla-affordable-housing-projects-list-2003-to-present)

## Project Tasks
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values and corrected data types.
   - Removed or imputed invalid entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualized distributions and relationships.
   - Identified patterns in ZIP code data.
3. SQL Operations:
   - Summarized datasets by ZIP code.
   - Joined datasets for combined analysis.
4. Hypothesis Testing:
   - Investigated the relationship between housing projects and health scores using statistical methods.

## Results
- Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence of a relationship between affordable housing units and restaurant health scores.
